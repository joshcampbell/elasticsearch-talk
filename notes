# The Rosetta Stone

Elasticsearch's storage mechanism, if you squint, is very similar to the model
you're familiar with from relational databases. During this talk, I'll be unable
to avoid using certain terms interchangably:

relational vs elasticsearch
----------    -------------
database  <-> index
table     <-> type mapping
row       <-> document
column    <-> field

# Some Interesting Elastisearch Queries

`
curl localhost:9200/_mapping
`

Dumps all of the mappings of all of the types in all of of your indices.

Searches for documents containing a precise string value in a field.

Performs a full-text search over all of the documents in the index.

First-created document containing a precise string value in a field.

Last-created document containing a precise string value in a field.
